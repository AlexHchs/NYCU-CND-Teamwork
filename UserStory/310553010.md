1. **As a** parent with my baby,  
**I want** to call a taxi with a child safety seat,  
**so that** my baby can hardly get hurt if an accident occurs.  
  
2. **As a** passenger that frequently travel to certain spots,  
**I want** to travel to recent destination by a few clicks,  
**so that** I don't need to refill the destination again.  
  
3. **As a** tired passenger,  
**I don't want** the driver chat with me,  
**so that** I can get some sleep during the ride.
